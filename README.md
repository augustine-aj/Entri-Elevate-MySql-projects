## Overview
The Global Store Database Project is designed to manage and analyze information about products and orders in a store. The project involves creating a relational database with two primary tables: Inventory (previously named Products) and Orders. This README provides detailed steps for setting up the database, populating it with sample data, and performing various SQL queries to extract meaningful insights

## Database Creation
To create the database and selected it for use.

## Table Structure
### Inventory Table
The Inventory table stores detailed information about products.

### Orders Table
The Orders table keeps track of the orders made for the products.

## Data Insertion
Insert sample data into the Inventory and Orders tables.

## SQL Queries
### Retrieving Data
- Select all records from the Inventory table.
- Select all records from the Orders table.

### Data Analysis
- Select distinct categories from the Inventory table.
- Select the top 5 most expensive products.
- Select product names with a quantity greater than 10.
- Calculate the total inventory price.
- Count the number of products in each category.
- Select names and prices of products with zero quantity.

## Views
- Create a view for expensive products (products with a price above the average price).
- Join Inventory and Orders to get product names and order quantities.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive overview of setting up and managing a relational database for a global store. It demonstrates various SQL operations including table creation, data insertion, and complex queries for data retrieval and analysis. This database can be expanded and modified to suit additional business needs and use cases.
